## Addition information
The genre of the game is "walker", made in the style of "top-down". The goal of the game is to collect all bonuses. A character controlled by a player can move around a pre-created map. There are enemies and bonuses on the map. The character can attack enemies. The character and enemies have a health reserve.
The application is split into scenes. There is a collision system between map objects / enemies / character. Enemies and main character are animated with sprites using requestAnimationFrame. A camera has been created that moves behind the player and rests against the edges of the map when the player approaches them.
The map is implemented through the "tiled" program, which produces a json file, which in turn is used in the js-code.
During the implementation of the project, ES6 tools such as SASS, ES6 core, requestAnimationFrame were used.
